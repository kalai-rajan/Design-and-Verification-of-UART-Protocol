# Design-and-Verification-of-UART-Protocol
In this project, UART protocol is designed to send and receive 8 bit data serially using Verilog  HDL. 
A Testbench devoloped using System verilog based on Sytem verilog Testbench Architecture to verify the  
functionality of the design. The Testbench and design are simulated using Questasim & Modelsim tools.
